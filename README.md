# globant_bonus

The purpose of the projects is evaluate different tools of data engineer such as API, SQL and Cloud.

## Description

In the file Globantâ€™s Data Engineering Coding Challenge.pdf you will found the instruction step by step for develop the challenge.

the bonus its to make an arquitecture of the globant challenge in a cloud

## Getting Started

### Tools

```
terraform
putty
aws
docker
```

### Installing

* to begin we download terraform and execute in terminal the command

* terraform will help to us to configurate the infraestructure of the cloud, in this case we select AWS to make the connection.

* in AWS we have to create an instance that we can host our containers, so we configurate the tools we need such as security group, vpc, IAM role, EC2 .....

* When we done the configuration of aws, we create a ec2.tf file to configurate the connection and the set up for the aws cloud.

* When we deployed the instances we can validate with putty the connection to the linux instance

* Next we need to install docker and with the user we begin to create a container in docker

* with the command docker images we validate the images

* the next step is run the docker with the command

```
sudo docker run -d -it -p 5000:5000 cradaca39/globant-test:1.0.0

```

* Then we would found our registry in docker hub with the command

```
sudo docker push cradaca39/globant-test:1.0.0

```
* Finally we have our project api in container

* We find our docker file in the globant challenge project
